  "why_not_passing": {
    "main_reasons": [
      "Missing critical cloud infrastructure keywords that are essential for this role (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS services)",
      "Experience descriptions don't emphasize scalability, distributed systems, or microservices architecture",
      "No clear demonstration of DevOps practices or CI/CD pipeline experience"
    ],
    "ats_perspective": "ATS systems scan for exact keyword matches and semantic relevance. This resume lacks 60% of the critical technical terms from the job description. The system would flag it as 'underqualified' because key technologies (containerization, orchestration, cloud platforms) are either absent or not prominently featured."

    {
      "keyword": "Docker",
      "importance": "critical",
      "why_matters": "Docker containerization is fundamental to modern DevOps practices. Its absence suggests you may not have hands-on experience with containerized deployments, which is a dealbreaker for this role."

    {
      "keyword": "Kubernetes",
      "importance": "critical",
      "why_matters": "Kubernetes orchestration is explicitly mentioned as a required skill. Without it, the hiring team will assume you can't manage production-scale containerized applications."

      "keyword": "Microservices Architecture",
      "importance": "high",
      "why_matters": "The role requires designing and maintaining microservices. Not mentioning this suggests you may have only monolithic application experience, which doesn't meet the job's architectural needs."

    {
      "keyword": "CI/CD Pipeline",
      "importance": "high",
      "why_matters": "Continuous integration and deployment is core to the DevOps workflow. Its absence indicates you might not be familiar with automated testing and deployment processes."

      "keyword": "AWS (Lambda, ECS, ECR)",

    "experience_gaps": "The job requires 3-5 years of DevOps experience with proven track record in cloud infrastructure. Your resume shows software development experience but doesn't clearly articulate infrastructure management, monitoring, or deployment automation responsibilities. Hiring managers need to see specific examples of infrastructure you've built, scaled, or maintained.",
    "skills_gaps": "Critical technical gaps: No container orchestration tools mentioned, no infrastructure-as-code experience (Terraform, CloudFormation), no monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana). The job emphasizes these as day-1 requirements, and their absence suggests a fundamental skills mismatch.",
    "qualification_gaps": "While you have a CS degree, there's no mention of relevant certifications (AWS Certified Solutions Architect, Kubernetes Admin) that would validate your cloud expertise. For senior roles, certifications help compensate for experience gaps."

      "current_state": "Experience bullets focus on feature development and team coordination but lack infrastructure/deployment specifics",
      "problem": "Job descriptions emphasize WHAT you built (infrastructure, pipelines, monitoring systems) not just development work. Your bullets don't show you've operated in a DevOps capacity",
