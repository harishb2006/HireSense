## Hour 1 – Project Setup & Understanding

### Project Name
**AI Resume & Mock Interviewer (HR-Tech)**

### What This Project Does
This project is an AI mentor for job seekers.

It:
- Explains **why a resume is getting rejected**
- Finds **missing or weak skills** compared to a job description
- Generates **mock interview questions** based on those weaknesses
- Gives feedback using the **STAR framework**

In short:  
**It tells users what is wrong with their resume and trains them to fix it.**

---

### What I Did in This Hour

- Created a GitHub repository
- Set up the project structure
- Learned **basic Python concepts**
- Learned **FastAPI basics** (what it is and why it’s used)
- Understood the full idea and workflow of the project
- Researched how resume analysis and mock interviews work
- Collected learning resources for Python, FastAPI, and AI

---

### Current Status
- No features implemented yet
- Clear understanding of the problem and solution
- Ready to start backend development

---

### Next Steps
- Learn FastAPI in more depth
- Create first API endpoint
- Handle resume upload (PDF)
- Start resume + job description analysis

---

**Day 1, Hour 1 completed**





## Hour 2 – FastAPI Foundations & Server Setup

**Time:** 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM

### What I Did in This Hour

* Set up a **basic FastAPI server**
* Learned about **Python virtual environments**

  * Why virtual environments are important
  * How they isolate dependencies
* Installed and configured:

  * `fastapi`
  * `uvicorn`
* Understood the **basic FastAPI app structure**

  * `FastAPI()` instance
  * Root (`/`) endpoint
  * Running the server using Uvicorn
* Learned core FastAPI concepts:

  * What an **API endpoint** is
  * How request–response works
  * Difference between FastAPI and traditional frameworks
* Explored:

  * Automatic API docs (`/docs`)
  * Swagger UI and why it’s powerful for backend development

---

### Key Learnings

* FastAPI is:

  * Fast ⚡
  * Pythonic
  * Built for modern AI & ML-based applications
* Virtual environments are **mandatory** for real-world projects
* FastAPI’s auto-generated docs make backend testing extremely easy
* This backend stack is **perfect for AI-based products** like HireSense

---

### Current Status

* FastAPI server is running successfully
* Virtual environment is properly configured
* Basic understanding of FastAPI workflow
* No business logic implemented yet

---

### Next Steps

* Learn FastAPI deeper:

  * Path parameters
  * Request body & response models
* Create structured API endpoints
* Start implementing **resume upload (PDF handling)**
* Prepare backend for resume + job description analysis

---

✅ **Day 1, Hour 2 completed**

If you want, next we can:

* Draft **Hour 3 (PDF upload + parsing plan)**
* Or start writing **actual FastAPI code step-by-step** for HireSense (perfect since you’re a Python beginner 🚀)
